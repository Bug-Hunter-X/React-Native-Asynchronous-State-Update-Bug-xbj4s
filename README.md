# React Native Asynchronous State Update Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications related to asynchronous operations and state updates. The `fetch` call within the component is asynchronous, and if the state is updated before the `fetch` call completes, it can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Bug Description

The problem occurs because the `setUsers` function is called before the data has been fetched. This leads to a brief period where the `users` state is empty, causing the component to render nothing or throw an error if it attempts to access `users` properties before data is loaded.  The solution involves carefully handling the asynchronous nature of the `fetch` operation.

## Solution

The solution provided handles this by performing the state update only after the `fetch` call completes successfully. Error handling is also included to gracefully manage potential network issues.
